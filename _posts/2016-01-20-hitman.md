This is a picture of my dad, Orion. He works mostly at night. He says he has eyes like a bat, and sunlight makes it too hard for him to find his way among the stars.

My dad is a mercenary. He says since no shame in it, because even good guys sometimes need a hired gun.

From what I can tell though most people my dad works for her kind of shady. Take that bear, for example. He doesn't want to get his hands dirty, but he would like to wrap his gums around that rabbit.

There's that unicorn, who everyone knows is fictional. But his real checks always clear in a real bank, so we can eat real food instead of glitter and rainbow farts.

And then there's Taurus, the bull. Sometimes the gods on Mount Olympus. My dad to go out and get him a good clubbing. Sometimes Taurus pays him to back off. It's a vicious cycle, one that's been going on for about 32,000 years at last count. 

In another 5,000 years, I'm going to graduate, and then I'll have to figure out if I want to follow in my father's footprints. I started shadowing him sometimes, in secret, to see if I'm any good at vigilante justice. So far, the Gemini twins are pleased with my work. They're the ones who paid me to take out the swan.

She was delicious.
